      </h2>
      <p>Eye in the Sky is a project created for the course Advanced Graphics and Interaction at KTH in the fall of
        2020.

          <h3 id="about-title"> Goal</h3>
          <p id="justfy-text"> The goal of this project was to create an interactive social socially distant asymmetric
            multiplayer experience combining methods advanced computer graphics with advanced human-computer
            interaction. </p>

          <h3 id="about-title"> Motivation </h3>
          <p id="justfy-text"> The primary motivation for creating this project was to expand our own skill-sets and
            learn more about game design, AR and modelling. Another motivation was the wish to create a fun experience
            where the players are able to interact with each other while still being able to be physically distant. </p>

        <h3 id="about-title"> Process </h3>
        <p id="justfy-text">
          Eye in the Sky is a project that was created over the course of around 16 weeks and the process was divided
          into two phases.
        </p>

        <p id="justfy-text">
          <b>Phase 1</b><br />
          During the first phase a lot of focus was put on network implementation, cross-platform connection, augmented
          reality and movement of our 3d player. We also started creating models for the environment, which we had
          envisioned to be planets. Some difficulties came with having the game environment be spherical, since gravity
          and especially the player camera were difficult to implement. Parts of the environment were finished and we
          had our first AR prototype for Eye in the Sky on the tablet but it became clear that having a spherical game
          world would become too big of a challenge and therefore the decision was made to change plans and discard much
          of the work previously done.
        </p>
        <p id="justfy-text">
          <b>Phase 2</b><br />
          During phase 2 we had reimagined the arena for the players and decided on floating islands instead of the
          planets. These were modelled, colored and populated with old and new models. Characters were designed,
          modelled, rigged and animated. We also created crucial interaction mechanics, such as a jump pad for the
          player to use to jump between islands. Pineapples were added for the player to collect and a Heads Up Display
          (HUD) was programmed to count the pineapples as well as show a countdown.
          Instead of an AR implementation for the Eye in the Sky player, we opted for a gyroscope on the tablet and
          added a freeze interaction. Lastly, we created original music in the form of a theme for the game.
        </p>
        <p id="justfy-text">
          Design and game mechanics were polished during the last weeks of the project work, as well as particle effects
          being added.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="twelve columns" id="about-section">
        <h3 id="about-title"> Challenges </h3>
        <p id="justfy-text">
          We faced several obstacles during our project work, from which we learned to adapt and
          compromise.
        </p>

        <p id="justfy-text">
          <b>Spherical game world</b><br />
          One challenge was the implementation of gravity for the spherical planets and the camera movement required for
          it. Sadly we didn’t have the time to overcome this challenge and instead adapted to a different option.
        </p>
        <p id="justfy-text">
          <b>AR</b> <br />
          The implementation of AR on the tablet as a cross-platform game mechanic - which would have enabled the Eye in
          the Sky to walk around the room to view the game environment - showed to be very problematic. The
          synchronization between platforms was the main offender here and this problem could unfortunately not be
          solved. Instead, we resorted to having the player on the tablet use a gyroscope.

          <p>
            Unity is a popular cross-platform game engine.
            Unity was used as the base for our game and all game logic
            was handled by internal Unity components and by custom
            components written in the C# programming language;
            this includes player movement and interactions, physics,
            animation handling, sound, visual effects and more.

            UV-mapping, rigging and animating the 3D-models and more.

            We used Mirror to handle all network traffic between the game clients
            and the game host/server; this includes spawning players, updating world state,
            tracking player and item positions/transforms and more.

            During this project I have been involved in making 3D models and designing environments for the game.
            I have also created the particle system for the home base area, indicating where the players should
            drop the pineapples. In addition I have also created the interaction mechanics for the jump pad which
            makes it possible to move between the different planets.
